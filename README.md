@"👕 CIFAR-10 Image Classification Project
This project uses deep learning models to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset.
The dataset consists of 60,000 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class (airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck).

🧠 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build and compare multiple neural network architectures to accurately classify CIFAR-10 images into one of 10 categories. Three models were implemented: DenseNet, DropoutNet, and CNN. The **CNN model** was the best performing model and was used for deployment.

  - Fully Connected (Dense) Network
  - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
  - Dropout-enhanced Network
- Evaluate models and identify the best performing
- Save the best model for predictions
- User input prediction via terminal
- Streamlit web app deployment
- Automatic visualization of training performance (loss and accuracy)

🧩 Dataset
CIFAR-10 dataset contains:
- Training set: 50,000 images
- Test set: 10,000 images
- Image size: 32×32 color images
- Classes: airplane, automobile, bird, cat, deer, dog, frog, horse, ship, truck

🛠️ Installation
Clone this repository:
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CIFAR10_IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION.git
cd CIFAR10_IMAGE_CLASSIFICATION

Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate      # on Windows
source venv/bin/activate   # on macOS/Linux

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Or install Streamlit separately:
pip install streamlit

🏋️‍♂️ Training the Models
To train each model separately:
python train_dense.py
python train_cnn.py
python train_dropout.py

After training, models and metrics will be saved automatically in the `models/` folder.

🧾 Evaluation
Evaluate trained models on the test set:
python evaluate_models.py

🔮 Prediction
Make a prediction from a single image input:
python predict_input.py

For deployment via web app:
streamlit run deployment/app.py

📊 Results
| Model            | Test Accuracy | Notes                  |
|-----------------|---------------|-----------------------|
| Dense Network    | ~60-65%       | Simple fully connected |
| CNN              | ~91%          | Best performing        |
| Dropout Network  | ~54-58%       | Reduced overfitting    |

📈 Future Improvements
- Implement data augmentation
- Add confusion matrix visualization
- Deploy model with Streamlit (done) or Flask web app
- Experiment with ResNet or other architectures
